This branch contains a fix that allows Jupyter to use the sync API.

test_nested_transformations_multi.py now hangs.

All other test timings are unaffected within a few hundredths.

test_nested_transformations_multi_spawn.py runs fine, and so does 
seamless-dask/tests/test_nested_transformations_multi.py.

I am leaving this TODO note in place.

Perhaps the root cause can be found and this fix can become integrated fully.

Or we could disallow nested in-process transformations if Jupyter is running.
It really seems to be "nested in-process transformations". The fact that the sync API is used top-level 
doesn't play a role: I have added test_nested_transformations_multi_async.py and it also hangs.
In contrast, the spawn version and Dask version both run fine.

I have verified that test_nested_transformations_multi_async.py runs fine in the main branch.
It even runs under Jupyter if you make the test function code top-level 
and replace the `asyncio.run(get_results())` by `await get_results()`
